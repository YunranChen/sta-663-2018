Computational Statistics and Statistical Computing

This course is designed for graduate research students who need to analyze complex data sets, and/or implement efficient statistical algorithms from the literature. We focus on the following analytical skills:

Functional programming in Python: Python is a dynamic programming language that is increasingly dominant in many scientific domains such as data science, computer vision and deep learning. Modern parallel and distributed programming tools such as Spark and TensorFlow encourage a functional programming style that emphasizes use of pure functions and lazy evaluation. The course will develop fluency in the Python language and the standard scientific libraries numpy, scipy, pnadas, matplotlib and seaborn, and showcase functional idioms for numerical algorithms.

Statistical algorithms: Statisticians need to understand the methods they use, so that the methods can be used appropriately and extended if necessary. Using Python, we will study common numerical algorithms used in statistical model construction and fitting, starting with the basic tools for solving numerical problems, and moving on to statistical inference using optimization and simulation strategies.

Improving performance: With real-world data being generated at an ever-increasing clip, we also need to be concerned with computational performance, so that we can complete our calculations in a reasonable time or handle data that is too large to fit into memory. To do so, we need to understand how to evaluate the performance of different data structures and algorithms, language-specific idioms for efficient data processing, native code compilation, and exploit resources for parallel or distributed computing. One rapidly evolving area are statistical approaches that capitalizes on the high-performance libraries originally developed for deep learning.

The capstone project involves the creation of an optimized Python package implementing a statistical algorithm from the research literature.
